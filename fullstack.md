Backend (Django + DRF):
Django handles server-side logic, database interactions, user authentication, and other backend functionalities.
Django REST Framework (DRF) provides APIs for the frontend to interact with the backend. It serializes data from Django models and exposes it through RESTful endpoints.
Frontend (React):
React manages the user interface and user experience. It fetches data from the backend APIs and renders it on the client side. React components handle user interactions and display data dynamically.
How They Work Together:
API Endpoints: Django/DRF creates API endpoints that React can call to fetch or send data. These endpoints handle CRUD operations and provide data in a format (typically JSON) that React can easily process.

Data Fetching and Display: React components make HTTP requests (using tools like axios or fetch) to the Django API endpoints. The fetched data is then used to update the component state and render the UI.

Form Handling: React can also handle form submissions to send data back to the Django server via API endpoints. Django processes this data, updates the database, and returns a response.

Routing: Django handles server-side routing (if using Django templates) and React handles client-side routing (if using React Router for single-page applications).

Steps to Ensure Full-Stack Integration:
Backend Configuration:

Define your models, serializers, and views in Django.
Set up URLs to route API requests to the appropriate views.
Frontend Configuration:

Set up React components to fetch and display data from Django APIs.
Implement form handling and user interactions in React.
Cross-Origin Requests:

Ensure that Django is configured to allow requests from your React appâ€™s domain using CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings.
Deployment:

Prepare both Django and React for deployment. This might involve building the React app for production and configuring Django to serve static files and handle API requests.
